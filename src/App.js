      <h3>Difficulties encountered and how I solved them</h3>
      <div className="steps">
      <p>Firstly, I had difficulties with the command line because I was having trouble going into 
        the right folders needed to run the different commands in. I solved this by checking and double 
        checking every folder which I was entering through the command line. 
        <br></br>
        Also, I had trouble with the commands themselves as they needed to be edited a bit to suit 
        the app names I was creating along with 
        how I wanted my app to work in react. I solved this by looking up how the command works before 
        running it in the command line.
